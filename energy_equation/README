This library defines energy euqations used in PGFem3D. The function defintions include
building stiffness matrices and residual vectors.

Residuals and stiffness are computed based on assumption that mechanical part is stationary as
staggered Newton Raphson iteration is implemented in PGFem3D.
 
The dependency is applied to both PGFem3D and energy euation, because
the energy equation takes Fnite element structures from PGFem3D and PGFem3D uses energy euations
for solving heat conduction problems.

This libray will be build when PGFem3D is build at the top level.
