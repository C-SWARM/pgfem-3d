How to compile pgfem3d code?

1. Download and compile pre-requisite libraries like: 
- hypre (v2.4.0b or above)
- suitesparse (v2.1.1 or above)
- vtk (v5.10.1 or above) - this is optional

2. Download Generalizsed_constitutive_model (GCM) - anywhere you want

3. Copy an approprite script "compile_xxx_xxx.sh" from this directory to the 
pgfem_3d root directory, then
- make sure to load the appropriate modules inside the script
- set the pre-requisite library paths inside of this script 
- and finally execute "sh compile_xxx_xxx.sh" to build pgfem_3d with GCM

After the successful compilation, pgfem3d executable "PGFem3D" should be 
found at $PGFEM3D_INSTALL/bin


Note: With TTL presently the code compiles wth gcc compiler (and they may 
compile with Intel but it will run very slow)
