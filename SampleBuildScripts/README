How to compile pgfem3d code? A quick compilation guide as follow:

1. Download and compile pre-requisite libraries like: 

- hypre (v2.40b or above)            : http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/hypre/software.html
- suitesparse (v2.1.1 or above)      : http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html
                                     (only the AMD and UMFPACK routines are utilized)
- VTK (v5.10.1 or above) - optional  : http://www.vtk.org/
- Intel MKL                          : included w/ the Intel compiler suite, or can downloaded
- Tensor Template Library (TTL)      : included with the code

2. Download Generalizsed_constitutive_model (GCM) - anywhere you want

3. Copy an approprite script "compile_xxx_xxx.sh" from this directory to the 
pgfem_3d root directory, then

- make sure to load the appropriate modules inside the script
- set the pre-requisite library paths inside of this script 
- and finally execute "sh compile_xxx_xxx.sh" to build pgfem_3d with GCM

After the successful compilation, pgfem3d executable "PGFem3D" should be 
found at $PGFEM3D_INSTALL/bin


Note: With TTL presently the code compiles wth gcc compiler (and they may 
compile with Intel but it will run very slow)
