Notes on PFEM working:

-Renumbering requires a larger number of nodes on each processor.  If
 PFEM3d fails, try increasing the number of nodes in the system.  If
 this does not work, then there is a bug.  Please notify Matt Mosby.

-At this point, renumbering has been shown to be robust.  If you still
 encounter problems, please let me know. 7/29/2010

-I have begun splitting up some of the files for robust-ness
