This is the current version of PGFem3D, a parallel finite element
solver developed under the advisory of Prof. Karel Matous at the
University of Notre Dame.

PGFem3D relies on several external libraries. They are:

VTK-6.0	      	       : http://vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html
hypre-2.40b   	       : http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/hypre/software.html
ParMETIS-3.1.1	       : http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fsroot/sw/parmetis/OLD
suitesparse-2.1.1      : http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/
           	         (only the AMD and UMFPACK routines are utilized)
BlockSolve95	       : http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/BlockSolve95/

While many of these libraries have newer versions available, these
versions will not break our build tree and are known to work properly
for our cases. Modify the paths in ../Makefile.path appropriately
after compiling these external libraries.

It is recommended that all packages be compiled using the Intel
compiler and linked to the MKL libraries where appropriate. If you
choose to use the system libraries for cblas and lapack, uncomment
lines 77-80 in Makefile.path and supply appropriate link-line commands
for each library. Additionally, modify mkl_cblas.h and mkl_lapack.h in
$(pfem_incl_dir)/MKL_override to include the appropriate header files.

Typing make in this directory will build the internal support
libraries and then the main code. Compilation may be accelereated by
changing into $(pgfem_src_dir) and typing 'make -j NP' for parallel
build.
