# This test performs a simple box compression test
# to verifiy the restart of the PGFem3D
# First, it runs a crystal plasticity simulation for 5 steps and restarts the run from 4th step
# The comparision at the 5th step obtained by restart should match 
# results obtained from the full simulation runs.

# how to run
