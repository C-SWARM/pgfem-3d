# Two tests are implemented to test crystal plasticity orientation: tension and compression [1999 Zacharia]
# Number of partitions and number of elements are fixed to 8 and 257, respectively since the crystal orientations
# are generated randomly for specific meshes (257 elements and 8 partition domains).
#
# The time step requires 5000 to finish the whole simulation, but the tests only go to 50 steps in order to save
# the run time on Jenkins. Since the crystal orientations are dependent on F ( especially elastic part), results
# are verified by comparing deformation gradients between computed and pre-computed values.
#
# how to run

# usage: ./run_test.sh [test_name] [gen_mesh]
#        [test_name] : test_name = tension or compression
#        [gen_mesh]  : if gen_mesh = 1: cleanup everything and re-generate the finite element mesh and run the test
#                            otherwise: run the test without re-generating meshes
