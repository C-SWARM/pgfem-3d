This directory contains the source code for renumbering routines using
ParMETIS. The source code is in the src/ directory, the header files
are in the include/ directory, and the library(s) are in the lib/
directory.

While this library only needs access to the ParMETIS header files and
not the libraries, remember to link the ParMETIS and METIS libraries
to whatever executable it will be used in.  Also, note that the
library must be linked BEFORE the ParMETIS and METIS libraries.
