This directory contains code to write PGFem3D output using the VTK
libraries. The VTK libraries provide optimized output routines with
the capability to write in binary format. Additionally, the output is
100% conformant to the VTK formats for which documentation is sparse.

OVERALL DESIGN
- Written in c++ for interface with VTK library, but should not use
  much c++ in functions which are to be called from the PGFem3D main
  code.
- Converter functions to create VTK objects from PGFem3D objecs and vice-versa
- Write function with option to output in binary or ASCII format.

FUTURE PLANS
The design of this wrapper is such that all mesh-related information
is passed to the read/write functions with the intention that future
versions will write EVERYTHING to compressed VTK format, allowing for
restart from output files through reader/allocator
functions. Additionally, all data could be visualized/inspected in
ParaView etc. rather than inspecting ASCII files (which is virtually
useless anyhow).
